	+ The empty URL (i.e. http://localhost:8000/) will route to the first page(global stream) of my application.

	+ Using default Django database configuration based on a SQLite database file (named db.sqlite3)

### Part #1. Social Network UI and Login

Implemented the **HTML pages** for my site and implement a **basic login function** using Django’s authentication package.

	+ Demonstrated the high­-level architecture of an MVC application, including basic features of the Django framework.

	+ Demonstrated a basic understanding objects to represent forms, hierarchical templates,
	  and user authentication using the Django framework.

	+ Gained experience using iterative development, similar to what I would encounter
	  using a modern agile software development process.
